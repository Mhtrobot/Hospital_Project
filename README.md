In this project, user can either Sign Up as an admin, doctor, employee or a patient.
The interface is simple and easy to use, connected to a database which is in the following folders.

# Admin
The admin uses pre-generated user and password, it can be changed only by the source code "App"; Admin can either add or remove the staff, increase or decrease salary of staff. The admin table also contains request checkbox so it could easily work on members needs.

# Doctor
Doctor's interface is a flexible space. The ability of seeing the profile, rating, salary, and the patients that are related to the doctor are in Doctor's Page.
The ability of requesting to admin, for increasing or resigning has been made the platform easy and accessible. The Doctor can also change his/her status of being Available or Not Available, so it could be visible for the patient to request a visit.

# Employee
Has the exact same options like the doctor but without the List of The Patients. Employees can also send their requests and problems with the admin and have a full communicatio.

# Patient
The main focus of this app is perchased here, Every user can either SingUp or Login as member. Their info will be recorded and will be used in a correct way. This app also includes a high security system for logging in or editting data.
Every person can edit its personal information and can also rate every doctor that visits the person. This app also has the Delete Account feature so it can be easy for the user to delete its account.
